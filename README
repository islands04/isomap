This is a Python implementation of Isomap built on top of my mds library (https://github.com/stober/mds/). This supports both k and epsilon nearest neighbor graph computations prior to determining isometric distances between data points. You can find more info about isomap, as well as a Matlab implementation here: http://isomap.stanford.edu/.
